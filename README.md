Introduction:

Welcome to this little playthrough of Alice in Wonderland.
We set the scene by starting off in the room in which Alice 
sees the white rabbit dissapearing through a door. The only 
problem is that the door is the size of a mouse and Alice can't 
get through! Help her find a way out of the room or she'll be trapped
here forever. 

Good luck. 

Controls: WASD + spacebar to move, left mouse button to interact with the 
environment and right mouse click to rotate the camera view.

Compilation:

Unzip the file into a folder that will be the home directory. 
In this directory, run **premake4 gmake** and **make**.
Then enter the A5-FinalProject directory and once again, 
run **premake4 gmake** and **make**. 
The executable can then be run using **./Final**, followed by the 
commandline argument **Assets/a5ProjectScene.lua**.
